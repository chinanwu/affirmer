# affirmer

Words of Affirmation are incredibly powerful. I wanted to make this web app to make it easier for folks who might not know how to affirm themselves or need someone else to help them.

## To Run This Locally

- `git clone` this repo into wherever you'd like to have this code
- Either:
  - Open this in your favourite IDE and in the terminal run `npm run serve`
  - Open your terminal and navigate to the folder you cloned this repo in and run `npm run serve`
- Navigate to `localhost:8080`
- Affirmations!

## See an Issue?

This is my first(-ish) Vue project so I expect this code to be messy, so if you see a bad practice or a bug, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/chinanwu/affirmer/issues)!

## Want to add/edit an affirmation?

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/chinanwu/affirmer/issues)! Just state what you'd like to add or edit and I can add it to the list of affirmations. If you prefer to do it yourself, fork this repo, edit the affirmations.js file, and [make a merge request](https://github.com/chinanwu/affirmer/pulls)!

## Thanks so much!

If there is anything you need help with or information on, please feel free to reach out! I will help in any way I can.
